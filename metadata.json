    "description": "The Multi-CAST **English** ([sout3282](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/sout3282)) corpus contains auto- biographical narratives taken from the *[Freiburg English Dialect Corpus](https://fred.ub.uni-freiburg.de/)* (FRED, [English Dialects Research Group 2005](Source#cldf:englishdialectsresearchgroup2005)), which has been compiled under the supervision of Bernd Kortmann and Lieselotte Anderwald at the University of Freiburg from texts recorded during the 1970s and 80s as part of various oral history projects.\n\nThe texts annotated for Multi-CAST were recorded with older working-class speakers from southern and southeastern England. They depict everyday scenes and personal experiences from the speakers' lives: recurring topics include agriculture, animal husbandry, shipwrighting, work in the London docks, and the two World Wars.\n\nA subset of the texts in this corpus (version 2207) have been time-aligned at the phone level for a [data set](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/languages/sout3282) in the [DoReCo project](https://doreco.huma-num.fr/).\n\nThe audio recordings (WAV, MP3) in this corpus are in the public domain.",
